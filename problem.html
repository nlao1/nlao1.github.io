      Problems Uyghur Muslims are facing
    </h1>  
  <h2>
    The Chinese government is depriving Uyghur Muslims of their fundamental rights and is forcing them
  to do things that are considered unlawful in their religion. 
  </h2>
     Millions of Uyghur Muslims are being taken to detention camps and are being interrogated/beaten just because of their religion.
    The Chinese government is killing and torturing Uyghurs as well as trying to separate them from their children
    and other family members. The Chinese government believes that this treatment towards Uyghur Muslims is justified because they are
    a"threat to national security." In reality, Uyghurs are innocent people facing injustice and cruelty just because of their faith.
