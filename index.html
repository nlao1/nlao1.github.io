    <h1> Save the Uyghur Muslims </h1>
    <h2> What is happening to the Uyghurs in China? </h2>
    <p> The Chinese government has detained up to a million Uyghurs in concerntation camps in what the state defined as
    "re-education camps." China initinally denied the existence of these camps however later stated it was necessary to stop violence in 
    Xinjiang. The Chinese government is torturing Uyghurs and forcing them to do things that are unlawful (haram) in their religion, 
    such as eating pork and drinking alcohol during the holy month of Ramadan.The Chinese government is also carrying out forced 
    sterilizations and abortions on Uyghur women.</p>
