      Hi! My name is Jeba Islam. I am passionate about computer science, and I continue to seek programs that will help me gain more exposure to coding 
      and various programming languages. My personality type is INTJ-T, and in my free time, I enjoy reading mystery novels. 
      I also enjoy binge-watching horror movies on Netflix. I hope I can continue to learn from my experiences and strive to 
      become a better version of myself every day.
